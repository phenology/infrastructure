##  Knowledge base
* Matrix Computations
Distributed Matrix Computations, Reza Zadeh, Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University - [presentation](https://stanford.edu/~rezab/nips2014workshop/slides/reza.pdf).
Matrix Computations and Optimization in Apache Spark, Reza Zadeh and et al., [article at KDD 2016](https://stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/linalg.pdf). 

* Storing a sparse matrix
Spark uses Compressed sparse column (CSC) to store local matrixes. The following wiki-page explains the different storage approaches for sparse matrixes and their advantages, [storing a sparse matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Storing_a_sparse_matrix).
